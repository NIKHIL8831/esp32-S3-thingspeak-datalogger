# esp32-S3-thingspeak-datalogger
This project uses the ESP32 S3 board to generate random analog values (0â€“1023) and send them to the ThingSpeak server over Wi-Fi every 15 seconds. The data is visualized on a time-series graph on the ThingSpeak dashboard. This simulates sensor data logging without using any physical analog sensor.
